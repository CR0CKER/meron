package jp.nonbili.meron.ui

// Read-state bookkeeping for overlapping read/unread writes on the open
// conversation's messages: scroll-driven marks, the whole-thread mark and the
// reader's own toggles.
//
// Each write is an op that sets some messages to a target state. Per message,
// the ledger keeps the last state the core confirmed and the ops still in
// flight. What the UI shows is the newest pending op's target, or the confirmed
// state once nothing is pending. Finishing an op — success or failure — only
// recomputes that, instead of restoring a snapshot the op captured when it
// began: such a snapshot can hold another op's optimistic state that has since
// been turned back, and restoring it would show a state no request produced.
//
// The UI's messages can be replaced behind the ledger's back (a reload hands
// back the core's copy, which lacks pending writes), so `overlay` reapplies
// pending state to whatever is installed, and `begin`/`finish` report the
// resulting state of every message they touch — not only the ones the ledger
// saw change — for the caller to reconcile against what it actually shows.
//
// Ops must finish in the order they began (readMarkMutex serializes them), so a
// later success rightly overrides an earlier one.
